	List of maintainers for the ReactOS project

This file purpose is to give newcomers to the projet the responsible
developers when submitting a pull request on GitHub, or opening a bug
report on Jira.

This file will notably establish who is responsible for a specific
area of ReactOS. Being a maintainer means the following:
	- that person has good knownledge in the area
	- that person is able to enforce consistency in the area
	- that person may be available for giving help in the area
Being a maintainer does not mean the following:
	- that person is dedicated to the area
	- that person is working full-time on the area/on ReactOS
	- that person is paid
	- that person is always available

We have no supported (paid) areas in ReactOS.

When submitting a pull request on GitHub and looking for reviewers,
look at that file and ask for a review from some of the people (M, R
- the most recently active in the area) listed in the matching area,
also, assign the pull request to the M person. Don't ask for a review
from all the listed reviewers.
Also, when submitted a pull request on GitHub, rules defined in
CONTRIBUTING.md apply. And if the maintainer is not available and
reviewers approved the pull request, developers feeling confident
can merge the pull request.
When submitting a bug report on Jira, if you want to be sure to have
a developer with skills in that area, write @nick from M people.

There should be one and only one primary maintainer per area.

In case of 3rd party code (also refered as upstream), the maintainer
is responsible of updating periodically the source code and of
managing local patches. He is not here to upstream code on your behalf.
As responsible, he may refuse a local patch if you did not try to
upstream your changes.

This file uses a similar format to the Linux kernel MAINTAINERS file.
Descriptions of section entries used here:
	M: Primary maintainer. Assign them pull requests
	   Use the GitHub, Jira, Real Name format for entry, squash if
	   some are overlapping
	R: Reviewers. Ask them for review on pull requests
	S: Status, one of the following:
	   Maintained:  Someone is handling that area
	   Upstream: This is 3rd party code, synced in our tree
	   Abandoned:  No one is handling that code anymore
	F: Files. Directories, files (wildcards allowed) covered in
	   this area
